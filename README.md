## 👋 About Me


My past experience in Siebel OpenUI (mostly JavaScript and jQuery) isn’t reflected here, as I was too shy to share my work publicly (impostor syndrome, I guess). Now, I’m training as a Python Developer and AI Specialist—so you’ll mostly find my student projects here, which will hopefully show my progress.

## ⚙️ My Mindset

### 🧠 Analytical & Technically Curious
I thrive on understanding how things work — from physical machines to abstract systems like Unix, TCP/IP, and CRM backends. I don’t just use tools; I dig into them, optimize them, and make them better.

### 🔄 Adaptive & Self-Reliant
My path shows a rare ability to adapt — switching between hands-on technical roles, large-scale IT projects, and consulting. Returning to previous roles (like the engraving shop) and succeeding solo also points to being self-directed and dependable.

### 🎓 Lifelong Learner
I continuously seek out education: vocational training, specialized IT certifications, distance learning, and now modern skills like Python and AI. I’m genuinely curious and committed to growth.

### 🤝 Bridge-Builder
I don’t just speak "tech" — I’ve played the role of translator between tech and non-tech teams. This has honed my communication skills and my ability to see both strategy and detail.

### 🚀 Goal-Oriented & Tenacious
I pursue opportunities deliberately — training, planning, and working toward long-term goals (like moving toward full-stack and AI). My direction shows ambition, clarity, and patience.

**TL;DR:**  
Pragmatic, curious, reliable, and strategically evolving.  
I don’t chase trends — I build a foundation, master what I touch, and steadily grow into new areas.
